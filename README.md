This project demonstrates advanced Python integration with databases and modern LLMs for data querying and summarization.

**Key Features:**
Convert natural language questions into MySQL queries using LLMs (ChatGroq).
Automatically fetch and display query results from MySQL.
Summarizes database results into easy-to-understand responses.

**Tech Stack & Libraries:**
Python
MySQL (mysql-connector-python)
Streamlit for UI
LangChain, LangChain Community Utilities, and ChatGroq for LLM-driven query generation
dotenv for secure environment management

**Project Details:**

Uses LLMs to generate accurate SQL queries based on natural language questions.
Provides an interactive interface to explore databases without writing SQL manually.
Ideal for learning database integration, LLM applications, and Python web apps.
